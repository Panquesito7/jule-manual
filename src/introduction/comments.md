# Comments
Comments are useful for understanding code, making comments and explanations, taking notes, and sometimes writing little jokes.

In general, two types of comment lines appear in programming languages: singleline comment and multiline comment. Some programming languages only support one. Jule supports both of these common approaches.

## Singleline Comments
```jule
// Singleline comment
```

## Multiline Comments
```jule
/*
  Multiline
  Comment
*/
```
