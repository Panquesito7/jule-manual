# Introduction

## Who Documentation is For
The explanations in this documentation assume that you already know programming. Therefore, everything is not explained from the very beginning. If you are completely new to programming, it may be better to learn programming from the most basic sources. If you already know programming, you can easily learn Jule with this documentation.

## Who Jule is For
Jule is good for a few groups of developers for many reasons. Some of these are described in this section.

### System Developers
Jule was designed as a system programming language. If you want to see notable system software developed with Jule, you can have a look at the reference compiler. The reference compiler is a bootstrapped compiler, meaning it is developed with Jule.

### Students
Jule is suitable for learning programming. Jule's simple structure and easy-to-understand, readable code encourage both effortless writing and understanding. In this way, students can learn without difficulty. Confusing syntax does not stand in their way.

### Open Source Developers
Jule is fully open source, including its standard library and reference compiler. Jule is a project open to community contributions. Thank you for every tool, library, framework and program you make open source.

### Developers Who Value Performance and Safety
Jule has the main design goals of being a safe programming language, such as memory safety, immutablity by default, no undefined behavior. And also, it is performant.
