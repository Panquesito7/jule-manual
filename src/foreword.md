# Foreword
This documentation is updated following the source code, according to the latest version of Jule. Some content may be not released yet, so it may be already documented here, but not yet available in the compiler you have.

Jule syntactically and structurally encourages code to be readable. It aims to create C++ code as safe as possible, and to optimize for secure code. With this documentation you will see the basics and some subtleties of Jule and you will understand Jule. You don't need to know C++ to learn and understand Jule. 

Jule is plain and simple, and suitable for developers of all levels. It also takes a very short time to learn. If you're not learning a language for the first time, it probably won't take much of your time.

With this documentation, it is possible to improve your Jule knowledge, programming, and analytical thinking skills. If you're just starting out programming, Jule could be a pretty good choice for you.
