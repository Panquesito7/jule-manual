# Statements
Statements separates with statement terminator.\
The statement terminator of Jule is the semicolon (`;`).\
Also, we sayed each statement separates with statement terminator and it is true. But statement terminator is always necessary? No.\
You can use statement terminator if you want write two or more statement as side-by-side. Except that, not necessary.\
Well, how we separate statements? Easy, please skip to next line or finish write.

For example:
```
fn main() {
    [STATEMENT_1]; [STATEMENT_2]
    [STATEMENT_3]
    [STATEMENT_4]
}
```
