# The Jule Programming Language
This version of the text assumes you're using the latest version of the JuleC compiler (compiled from source).\

Jule is a statically typed, compiled programming language. It's designed for system development, and for building maintainable and reliable software. It has syntax similar to today's programming languages. So, if you already know a language, it probably won't take you long to get used to Jule.

Jule is a very simple language. You will not have much difficulty in learning. It is a suitable language for developers of all levels.

The fact that Jule is simple does not diminish its power, as Jule is a pretty powerful language. It transpiles directly to C++ and compiles from C++ to an executable file, which means that the programming environment is familiar to C++ developers.

Jule is also a good choice as a simpler way to write C++, because at the developer's request Jule can also just transpile to C++. It is the developer's choice.

The purpose of Jule is to keep functionality high while maintaining a simple form and readability. It guarantees memory safety and does not contain undefined behavior.
