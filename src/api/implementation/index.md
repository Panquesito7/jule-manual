# Implementation

Header files alone have the entire implementation. So if you want to use them, just include them. If you want to have the whole API, just include `jule.hpp`.

## Manipulating

The algorithms and definitions that the API will implement may vary depending on the various `#define` directives. Relevant directives must be defined before the relevant header file is included.
